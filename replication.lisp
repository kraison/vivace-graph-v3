;;; Peer replication (WP-5): authority-scoped closed-subgraph export + manifest
;;; reconciliation.  Pure graph logic, no network -- the peer transport
;;; (peer-streaming.lisp) ships what these produce.  See
;;; docs/peer-replication-design.md §6/§7 and docs/peer-replication-branch-a-plan.md.
;;;
;;; A device's working set is the CLOSED subgraph reachable from its root(s),
;;; bounded by edge type, with two fail-closed rules:
;;;   - keep a vertex iff DISCLOSABLE-P (the app-supplied export predicate);
;;;   - keep an edge iff BOTH endpoints are disclosable (no dangling refs, and no
;;;     leaking the existence/id of undisclosed work).
;;; DISCLOSABLE-P may do bounded graph reads (e.g. walk to a tasking project), so
;;; the whole walk runs under one read snapshot for consistency.  Disclosure
;;; policy lives entirely in the app's predicate; the engine stays domain-agnostic.

under the export read snapshot.  Kept a first-class entry point so the app can
