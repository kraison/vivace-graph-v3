;;; Geometry refine operations for the spatial index.

;;; Public, general-purpose, dependency-free predicates used to refine the
;;; geohash index's candidate set into exact answers: great-circle distance
;;; (haversine), point-in-polygon (ray casting, holes honoured), and
;;; bounding-box overlap.  Heavier topology (intersection, union, validity
;;; repair) is delegated to GEOS via cl-geos in a later, optional module.
