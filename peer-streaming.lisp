;;; ===========================================================================
;;; Peer replication transport (WP-4 / WP-6 / WP-8).
;;;
;;; The network half of peer replication: a hub serves authority-scoped pulls to
;;; many devices; a device pulls its closed disclosable subgraph and applies it
;;; read-only.  Built ALONGSIDE -- never on top of -- the master/slave transport
;;; in transaction-streaming.lisp, which is left byte-for-byte as it is (design
;;; §1.3).  Reuses that file's framed-packet primitives verbatim
;;; (read-packet/write-packet, the 8-byte size framing, read/write-plist-packet,
;;; deserialize-tx-header-vector / deserialize-tx-write-vector).
;;;
;;; See docs/peer-replication-design.md (v2) and
;;; docs/peer-replication-branch-a-plan.md.  PT-n tags point at the §12
;;; pressure-test invariants.
;;;
;;; WIRE (peer-protocol v1).  Every entry is a self-size-framed packet; the type
;;; byte at offset 9 discriminates:
;;;   - peer-meta (#\M, 51 bytes, from transactions.lisp WP-0): origin-id, op-id,
;;;     lamport, op-class.  For op-class authored(0)/state-create(1) it is
;;;     followed by the ordinary tx packets ([tx-header][tx-write...]); the inner
;;;     tx machinery is reused unchanged.
;;;   - purge (#\U, below): a state-sync scope-exit -- a count then N*16-byte
;;;     node UUIDs (design §4/§7).
;;;   - plist (#\p): handshake, the :pull-end control marker, and the ack.
;;;
;;; OP CLASSES (design §4).  Branch A's pull ships only STATE-SYNC ops -- they
;;; assert current scope membership, are keyed by node UUID, are idempotent, are
;;; never deduped by op-id and never propagate back:
;;;   - state-create: a node currently in scope, shipped as a full create
;;;     (idempotent upsert by UUID -- so a re-pull simply refreshes it);
;;;   - purge: a node that LEFT scope, removed from the device (it still lives on
;;;     the hub).
;;; AUTHORED ops (op-id-deduped, cursor-advancing) are handled on the device
;;; apply side for forward-compat, but the cursor-resumed authored-op STREAM that
;;; emits them from the hub feed is a later increment (see PEER-PULL-PHASE);
;;; ongoing changes still converge here via membership reconciliation on each
;;; connection.
