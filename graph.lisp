a graph; use OPEN-GRAPH to reopen an existing one.

Keyword arguments:
  :MASTER-P / :SLAVE-P    create a replication master or slave.  Both require
                          :REPLICATION-PORT; a slave also requires :MASTER-HOST.
  :REPLICATION-PORT, :REPLICATION-KEY, :MASTER-HOST, :REPLAY-TXN-DIR
                          replication configuration (see Chapter 10 of the
                          manual).
  :BUFFER-POOL-P          whether to start the shared node buffer pool (default T).
  :BUFFER-POOL-SIZE       buffer pool size (default 100000).
  :VERTEX-BUCKETS / :EDGE-BUCKETS
                          initial linear-hash bucket counts (default 8).
  :HEAP-SIZE / :INDEX-SIZE
                          initial sizes (bytes) of the heap and indexes regions
                          (default *DEFAULT-HEAP-SIZE* / *DEFAULT-INDEX-SIZE*).
                          Both grow on demand, so these are only starting sizes.
  :SPATIAL-PRECISION      geohash precision of the spatial index grid (default 7,
                          ~150 m cells; 9 ~ 5 m).  Persisted with the index and
                          read back on OPEN-GRAPH.  See Chapter 13.
  :REPLICATION-FILTER     (slaves only) a predicate (NODE) -> boolean; the slave
                          applies only replicated writes whose node it accepts,
                          so it holds just a subset (e.g. its area of operations).
                          See MAKE-SPATIAL-REPLICATION-FILTER.
