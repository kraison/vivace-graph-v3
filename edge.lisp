also matches its subtypes (see RESOLVE-NODE-TYPE-IDS) -- mirroring MAP-VERTICES.
Restrict to a vertex's adjacent edges with :VERTEX plus :DIRECTION (:OUT or :IN),
or to a specific endpoint pair with :FROM-VERTEX and :TO-VERTEX.  Deleted edges
are skipped unless :INCLUDE-DELETED-P.  With :COLLECT-P, collect and return FN's
values; otherwise return NIL.  This drives OUTGOING-EDGES / INCOMING-EDGES.

NOTE: the fully-untyped, non-adjacency scan (no type and no vertex/endpoint)
walks the raw edge lhash, which reads LIVE edge versions and so BYPASSES MVCC
