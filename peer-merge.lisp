;;; ===========================================================================
;;; Peer replication Branch B: the per-field conflict resolver (B2a).
;;;
;;; When a replica applies an AUTHORED update to a node it also holds, the field
;;; values may have diverged (the ETL laptop, the hub, and mobile peers all edit
;;; the same nodes).  This resolves that divergence field-by-field, dispatching on
;;; an app-declared BUCKET.  Domain semantics (which field is which bucket, what a
;;; SAFE value is) live in the app's conflict policy (mine-action's
;;; conflict-policy.lisp); the engine supplies the mechanism -- the MERGE-POLICY
;;; seam, mirroring the DISCLOSABLE-P/EXPORT-PREDICATE seam.
;;;
;;; This file is the PURE core (no storage, no network): given the local node's
;;; data, the incoming op's new/old data, per-field Lamport stamps, and the
;;; policy, it produces the merged data + the stamps to persist + the conflicts to
;;; surface.  B2b/c/d wire in the stamp store, the policy slot, and the push
;;; transport that calls this.
;;;
;;; Buckets (design §11, as the app collapsed them in bucketing v1):
;;;   :create         new node by UUID -- never reaches the field resolver
;;;   :lww            (default) per-field last-writer-wins by (Lamport, origin)
;;;   :safety         BINARY safety class -- the app's SAFETY-MERGE decides the
;;;                   winner + whether to SURFACE (toward-danger auto-applies;
;;;                   only a release surfaces, keeping the dangerous local value)
;;;   :geometry       concurrent polygon/point edits SURFACE (never silent LWW)
;;;   :safety-surface edge-only in the app; no field case (folded to :geometry here)
