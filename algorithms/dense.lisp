;;;; graph-db/algorithms -- dense / matrix algorithms (Mode A, projection).
;;;;
;;;; The inherently in-memory, shortest-path-derived family: Floyd-Warshall all-
;;;; pairs shortest paths, edge-betweenness / edge-span clustering, and minimal
;;;; cut.  These materialize an in-memory PROJECTION (see projection.lisp) under a
;;;; read snapshot and run vendored graph-utils code on it; the persistent graph
;;;; is never touched (clustering/min-cut mutate only the transient projection).
;;;;
;;;; This file (a) extends the vendored :GRAPH-DB.PROJECTION graph with the few
;;;; more methods these algorithms need (copy-graph, map-edges, delete-edge,
;;;; distance-map, find-components, all-pairs, clustering, cut), and (b) adds the
;;;; VivaceGraph-side entry points that build a projection and map results back
;;;; to VG vertices.  The flow family (max-flow, bipartite matching) is Phase 4b.
