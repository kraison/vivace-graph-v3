;;;; graph-db/algorithms -- in-memory projection (Mode A substrate).
;;;;
;;;; Inherently in-memory algorithms (all-pairs shortest paths, max-flow,
;;;; clustering, min-cut) want a compact, integer-indexed, freely-mutable graph.
;;;; Rather than reinvent that, we VENDOR the graph-utils representation -- its
;;;; sparse adjacency matrix and matrix-backed graph class -- into a private
;;;; :GRAPH-DB.PROJECTION package, so those algorithms port nearly verbatim in
;;;; later phases.  The vendored code is the standalone graph-utils library by
;;;; Kevin Raison, trimmed to the projection's needs and stripped of its
;;;; multithreading locks (a projection is single-threaded transient scratch
;;;; built fresh under a read snapshot and discarded).
;;;;
;;;; WITH-GRAPH-PROJECTION (in :GRAPH-DB, at the bottom) materializes such a
;;;; projection from a VivaceGraph under a snapshot, carrying a bidirectional map
;;;; between dense integer indices and VG vertices so results map back to UUIDs.
;;;;
;;;; This phase vendors only what cross-validates native Dijkstra (sparse array +
;;;; graph class + graph-utils' hop-count find-shortest-path).  Phase 4 extends
;;;; this package with the flow/all-pairs/clustering bodies.
