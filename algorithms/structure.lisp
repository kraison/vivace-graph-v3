;;;; graph-db/algorithms -- structural algorithms (Mode B, native).
;;;;
;;;; Degree and degree distributions, BFS distance maps, weakly-connected
;;;; components, a DFS spanning tree, and the (BFS-eccentricity) graph center.
;;;; All run directly against the live ve/vev indexes under a read snapshot,
;;;; keyed by node UUID, and never mutate the graph.
;;;;
;;;; These are the matrix-free structural primitives: each is built on BFS/DFS
;;;; over ADJACENT-VERTICES, so none materializes an O(V^2) structure (unlike the
;;;; Floyd-Warshall-based center in graph-utils, which is a Mode-A concern).
