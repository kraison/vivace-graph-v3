;;;; graph-db/algorithms -- maximum flow & bipartite matching (Mode A, projection).
;;;;
;;;; The flow family, vendored from graph-utils onto the in-memory projection.
;;;; Edge weights are treated as capacities.  Algorithms run on a copy of the
;;;; projection (the residual graph), so the projection -- and the persistent VG
;;;; graph it came from -- are never disturbed.
;;;;
;;;; graph-utils calls this code "beta"; the cross-validation test (every
;;;; algorithm must agree on the unique max-flow value) is the guard.
;;;;
;;;; This file extends the :GRAPH-DB.PROJECTION substrate with capacities, a FIFO
;;;; queue, three max-flow algorithms (Edmonds-Karp, Dinic, Goldberg-Tarjan
;;;; push-relabel), and bipartite matching, then adds the VG-side entry points.
;;;;
;;;; OMITTED: graph-utils' Karzanov implementation -- it does not satisfy the
;;;; max-flow invariant (disagrees with the other three on the CLRS network), so
;;;; it is not ported rather than ship a knowingly-wrong result.  Node-capacity
;;;; expansion (graph-utils' :node-capacities? option) is also omitted; only edge
;;;; capacities are supported.
