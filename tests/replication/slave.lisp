;;;; Replication test -- SLAVE process.
;;;;
;;;; Driven by run-replication-test.sh.  Reads REPL_SLAVE_DIR, REPL_PORT and
;;;; REPL_WORK from the environment, connects to the master, and verifies two
;;;; phases:
;;;;
;;;;   CATCH-UP: the pre-connect TX1 (2 vertices + 1 edge) replays in full,
;;;;             with EXACTLY 2 vertices and 1 edge (no double-apply).
;;;;   LIVE:     the post-connect update + delete stream through, leaving
;;;;             exactly 1 live vertex named "Alice2" and 0 edges (deleting
;;;;             Bob removes the incident edge).
;;;;
;;;; Exits 0 on success, 1 on any failed check or timeout.
