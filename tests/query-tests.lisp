;;;; Tests for the embedded Prolog query language (prologc.lisp,
;;;; prolog-functors.lisp): select / select-flat / select-one over a graph,
;;;; using the is-a/2 built-in and the generated edge functors.
;;;;
;;;; Reuses the schema (g-person, g-knows) from graph-tests.lisp.  Queries run
;;;; against the dynamically-bound *graph* from WITH-TEST-GRAPH.
