;;;; S3 (GEOS-exact): find-nodes-intersecting and exact find-nodes-within on a
;;;; real indexed graph.  The discriminating fixture is POLY-POKEOUT -- a polygon
;;;; whose bbox CENTRE lies inside the AOI but which is NOT contained by it.  GEOS
;;;; exact containment excludes it from find-within; the centroid fallback wrongly
;;;; includes it.  This is exactly the approximation the add-on removes.
