;;;; S5: GEOS context-pool correctness under concurrency.
;;;;
;;;; Many threads hammer the seam (intersects / exact within / make-valid)
;;;; against a shared graph.  We assert: no thread errors; the pool never grows
;;;; past peak concurrency; a context is never checked out twice (debug flag);
;;;; every checkout is returned; concurrent results match a single-threaded run;
;;;; and geos-shutdown + re-init is clean.
