;;;; MVCC tests (the v2 node head + later the versioned write path / reaper).
;;;;
;;;; Phase 1: the head format gained commit-epoch (8) + prev-pointer (8),
;;;; appended after data-pointer (15 -> 31 bytes).  These tests serialize a
;;;; node head to a byte buffer and read it back, asserting the new fields
;;;; round-trip for both vertices and edges.
