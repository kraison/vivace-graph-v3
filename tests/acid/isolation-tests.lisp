;;;; ACID-ISOLATION-SUITE
;;;;
;;;; Verifies isolation semantics under concurrent access:
;;;;   - No dirty reads (uncommitted writes are invisible)
;;;;   - Snapshot is frozen at transaction start
;;;;   - Write-write conflicts are detected and force correct retries

;;; Test 1: no dirty reads
;;;
;;; T1 writes V=99 inside a transaction but has not committed yet.  While T1 is
;;; in-flight, the main thread reads V and must see the original value (0).
;;; The graph-cache is only updated when apply-tx-writes runs inside the TM
;;; lock at commit time; pre-commit writes live in T1's local-cache only.
