;;; point-in-ring-p uses the PNPOLY even-odd rule with strict `>` vertex
;;; comparisons.  This gives a "half-open" boundary: a point lying exactly on a
;;; shared edge is classified into EXACTLY ONE of two polygons that share that
;;; edge -- never both, never neither.  That tiling property (no double-count,
;;; no gap) is the guarantee callers can rely on; which specific side "wins" is
;;; an implementation detail and is NOT part of the contract.
