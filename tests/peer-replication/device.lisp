;;;; Peer-replication test -- DEVICE process.
;;;;
;;;; Driven by run-peer-test.sh.  Reads REPL_DEVICE_DIR, REPL_PORT and REPL_WORK
;;;; from the environment, opens an EMPTY device graph, and verifies:
;;;;
;;;;   PHASE 1 (seed pull): after PEER-SYNC the device holds exactly its closed
;;;;     disclosable subgraph -- site + survey + Find-1 + the two connecting
;;;;     edges -- and NOT the withheld Find-2 (nor its edge).
;;;;   PHASE 2 (purge): after the hub flips Find-1 to non-disclosable, a second
;;;;     PEER-SYNC PURGES Find-1 + its edge (scope exit), leaving site + survey.
;;;;   SCHEMA COMPAT (WP-6/PT-6): the device runs at schema (1 3) against a hub at
;;;;     (1 0) throughout -- a minor drift that must still sync (same major).  A
;;;;     final major bump to (2 0) must be REJECTED (peer-schema-incompatible).
;;;;
;;;; Exits 0 only if every check passes.
