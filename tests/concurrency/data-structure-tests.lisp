;;;; CONCURRENT-DATA-STRUCTURE-SUITE
;;;;
;;;; Tests concurrent access to the lower-level on-disk data structures
;;;; that underpin the graph:
;;;;
;;;;   1. Linear hash table under bucket splits: readers must not lose data
;;;;      while a writer triggers rehashing.
;;;;   2. Skip list under concurrent inserts: the per-node lock protocol must
;;;;      preserve all entries and key/value integrity.
;;;;   3. VE-index under simultaneous edge insertion and traversal: readers
;;;;      calling outgoing-edges must never observe corruption or crash while
;;;;      writers are adding edges to the same hub vertex.

;;; 4-bucket table) while N-1 reader threads repeatedly look up keys that
;;; were pre-inserted before the concurrent phase started.  No pre-inserted
;;; key may be lost or return a wrong value after the concurrent phase ends.
