;;;; CONCURRENT-ACID-REGRESSION-SUITE
;;;;
;;;; Regression guards for known ACID correctness issues in the transaction
;;;; engine, plus infrastructure-level safety checks (view/lhash ordering,
;;;; allocator isolation).  These tests are kept separate so they evolve in
;;;; lockstep with targeted bug fixes rather than being mixed into the
;;;; general suite.

;;; Test 1: multi-vertex lost-update regression
;;;
;;; The original sustained-conflict-storm test revealed that with exactly 2
;;; threads per vertex (low per-vertex contention), ~16% of increments were
;;; silently lost.  With low contention the exclusive-lock fallback rarely
;;; fires, exposing a subtle race in the MVCC validation path.
;;;
;;; This test replicates the original failing pattern as a permanent regression
;;; guard: 8 threads, 5 hot vertices, 2 threads per vertex, 20 increments each.
;;; Each vertex must end at exactly 40 (2 threads × 20 increments).
;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

;;;
;;; Every vertex ID returned by map-view must be present in the lhash (i.e.,

;;; guards against the view index being updated before the lhash commit
;;; completes, which would briefly expose a vertex that can't be retrieved.
;;;
;;; 8 threads each do 10 write+read cycles: insert one vertex, then scan the
;;; view and verify every entry is retrievable.  The simultaneous writes and
;;; reads create the interleaving needed to expose the invariant.
