;;;; Durable Lamport clock (peer replication, Branch B / PT-8).
;;;;
;;;; A peer-graph's logical clock must be monotonic ACROSS restarts: if it reset
;;;; to 0 after a crash, the replica's post-restart authored ops would get tiny
;;;; stamps and silently lose every LWW race (safety data dropped).  So the
;;;; counter is persisted on every advance and reloaded on open, and advanced to
;;;; MAX(local, received) whenever an op is applied.  Single-image test on a
;;;; device-role peer-graph (which mints a stamp per local commit); the multi-
;;;; writer conflict behaviour that consumes these stamps is tested by the
;;;; process-based peer harnesses.  Reuses the g-person schema from graph-tests.
