;;;; Multi-device peer-replication test -- HUB process.
;;;;
;;;; Driven by run-multi-peer-test.sh.  Builds the hub graph, registers TWO
;;;; devices (scopes "alpha" and "bravo", both rooted at the shared site), and
;;;; drives four phases, coordinating with both devices via flag files:
;;;;
;;;;   PHASE 1 (seed):   the closed authority-scoped graph (see schema.lisp).
;;;;   PHASE 2 (update): change the OVERLAP find fs1's status -> both devices
;;;;                     re-pull and converge (fan-out, not a conflict).
;;;;   PHASE 3 (re-task):fa1 team alpha->bravo: A PURGES it (left A's scope); B
;;;;                     still cannot see it (its only path is via survey-a,
;;;;                     which B never traverses) -- per-device purge.
;;;;   PHASE 4 (re-enter):fa1 team bravo->alpha: A re-gains it (purge -> re-entry,
;;;;                     PT-2); B unchanged.
;;;;
;;;; Coordination flags under REPL_WORK: the hub writes "ready"/"pN-ready" and
;;;; waits for "a-pN"/"b-pN" from both devices before advancing.
