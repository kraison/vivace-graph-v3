;;;; Branch B hub re-home apply (B2d-2): the resolver wired into the HUB push path.
;;;;
;;;; peer-merge-apply-tests drives the DEVICE pull-apply; this drives the HUB
;;;; REHOME-AUTHORED-OP -- the system-of-record side, where a device-pushed authored
;;;; op is applied through a JOURNALING transaction (so every other device pulls the
;;;; result) while merging field-by-field against the hub's live copy and preserving
;;;; the original op-id/origin/lamport on the re-journaled feed entry (design §5).
;;;;
;;;; Single image, no transport: build a device-authored op by hand and re-home it on
;;;; a hub peer-graph.  Assert: the merge lands (LWW / safety), the op-id is preserved
;;;; (a re-push is deduped), a release surfaces a conflict, and -- the hub's whole
;;;; point -- the merged result is RE-JOURNALED to the feed under the author's op-id.
;;;; Reuses g-person + the *apply-policy* (name :safety, else :lww) from the apply suite.
