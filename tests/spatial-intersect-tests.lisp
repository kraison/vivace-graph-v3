;;;; find-nodes-intersecting + exact-capable find-within, exercised in CORE
;;;; (no graph-db/geos loaded).  These assertions hold in the dependency-free
;;;; fallback mode: point candidates are always exact; extended-geometry
;;;; candidates use the coarse bbox path (which we assert only when GEOS is
;;;; absent, so the file is correct in any image).  Reuses GEO-PLACE +
;;;; node-geometry from spatial-hook-tests.lisp.
