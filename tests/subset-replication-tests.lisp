;;;; Tests for the subset-replication filter (spatial area-of-operations).
;;;;
;;;; A slave graph's REPLICATION-FILTER predicate decides which replicated
;;;; writes it applies; MAKE-SPATIAL-REPLICATION-FILTER builds one from an area
;;;; geometry.  APPLY-TRANSACTION runs the per-transaction FILTER-WRITES on a
;;;; slave.  End-to-end master/slave streaming is covered by the separate
;;;; process-based harness in tests/replication/; here we unit-test the filter
;;;; logic.  Reuses GEO-PLACE + NODE-GEOMETRY from spatial-hook-tests.
