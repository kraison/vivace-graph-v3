;;;; Tests for the built-in Prolog functors (prolog-functors.lisp): unification
;;;; and (in)equality (=, ==, /=), numeric comparison (<, >, <=, >=), arithmetic
;;;; (is), type checks (numberp, atom, var), regex-match, the lisp escape, and
;;;; the control functors call/1, if/2, if/3, plus unique/1 deduplication.
;;;;
;;;; These predicates are mostly pure logic, but a query still needs a live
;;;; *graph*, so we wrap each in with-test-graph.
