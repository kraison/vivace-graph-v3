;;;; Peer-replication PUSH conflict test -- DEVICE process (B2d-2b).
;;;;
;;;; Opens an empty device graph, pulls the find, edits it LOCALLY -- releases the
;;;; hazard (DANGER -> SAFE) and rewrites the note in a second commit (so its note
;;;; stamp has a higher lamport than the hub's) -- then PEER-SYNCs again, which pulls
;;;; (a no-op here) and then PUSHES the two authored ops to the hub.  The device keeps
;;;; its own SAFE value (a loser doesn't converge via pull until B3); the hub verifies
;;;; that its re-home rejected the release.  Exits 0 iff its local checks pass.
